ClubPenguin
===========

Houses Many (Not All!) Club Penguin SWFs.
Contains Fully Unmodified SWFs from 'Club Penguin Archives' (https://archives.clubpenguinwiki.info/wiki/Main_Page).
Only Minigames Have Been Modified, Requiring Some Mixing And Matching Of SWFs From A Couple Of Sources To Be Playable.
NOTE: The Above Is Because Many SWF's From The Archive Have Incorrect SWFs For Each Language, & Improper Bootstrap/Main SWF.

DOES NOT CONTAIN FULL ASSETS!
I Am Not Saving Full Club Penguin SWFs - Mostly Interactive Or Fun!
